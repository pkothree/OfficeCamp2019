# OfficeCamp2019
Presentation &amp; Workshop


## Office 365 & Azure <3 PowerShell
Short presentation, a lot of demoing.
Attendees are supposed to work through the topic with some guidance.
The session is also split in three parts, depending on how fast people are getting through the topics
It starts easy, f.ex. install a PowerShell module, and ends with PowerShell in an Azure Function triggered by a Microsoft Flow.
